# COVID_19_INDIA

In this I have used Covid 19 data for Country India and checked data based on confirmed , cured , deaths in the state/union territory.

1) At first I read csv file.
2) Then I grouped it according to date.
3) Then I used pie chart and shown the percentage of cases in state/union territory.
4) After then I used another data of only number of counts of cases in state / union territory.
